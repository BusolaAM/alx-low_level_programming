# This file is for the C-More Singly Linked List project. Here you will find the following projects

You will find the rest of the prototypes in our "lists.h" file

0-print_listint.c = Prints all the elements of a list

1-listint_len.c = Returns the number of elements in a linked list

2-add_nodeint.c = Adds a new node at the beginning of a list

3-add_nodeint_end.c = Adds a node at the end of a list

4-free_listint.c = Frees a singly linked list

5-free_listint2.c = Frees a singly linked list and sets the head to NULL

6-pop_listint.c = Deletes the head node of a linked list and returns the head node's data (n)

7-get_nodeint.c = Returns the nth node of a linked list

8-sum_listint.c = Returns the sum of all the data (n) of a linked list

9-insert_nodeint.c = Inserts a new node at a given position in a linked list

10-delete_nodeint.c = Deletes a node at a given index of a linked list

100-reverse_listint.c = Reverses a linked list

101-print_listint_safe.c = Prints a linked list taking any possible loop into consideration

102-free_listint_safe.c = Frees a list with or without a loop

103-find_loop.c = Finds a loop in a list
